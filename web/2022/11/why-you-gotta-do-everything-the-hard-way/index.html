        <p>Somebody thought writing this by hand would shake me out of my bleh, meh, feck, graaaaawwwww mood.</p>
        <p>This sucks, laying out a page by hand.  I guess better than doing it by foot.</p>
        <p>Updating just a few pages to be consistantly formatted has required a good bit of time.  There must be an easier way, right?</p>
        <p>Along those lines, I've set this up as a Git repository.  Yay.  It's a little easier now.</p>
        <p>I'm still writing this HTML code by hand and, in case you haven't noticed, HTML isn't super-handy.  That's my personal
            opinion of HTML and other ML's anyway.

        <p>Oh yeh, I forgot to explain myself about:</p>
        <h2>Capitalization, hasn't we seen enough?</h2>
        <p>You know what was a heading, and I know that was a heading, and so it's kinda like the title of an article, or a book, or a chapter, so 
            why should I have to do the Capitalization of the Title Thing on It?  I've unilaterally decided to stop capitalizing each work in a title,
            and you should stop it, too.  Thank you for your attention.
