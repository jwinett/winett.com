        <p>Somebody thought writing this by hand would shake me out of my bleh, meh, feck, graaaaawwwww mood.</p>
        <p>This sucks, laying out a page by hand.  I guess better than doing it by foot.</p>
        <p>Updating just a few pages to be consistantly formatted has required a good bit of time.  There must be an easier way, right?</p>
